# Cookie-Competition
This is a simple website developed for my family's yearly cookie competition.  
The goal is to have an easy way for my family to vote for the best cookie, as well as look at previous years results.  
Currently basic voting functionality is implemented. Results and UI/UX is next on the list.  
To run:  
Navigate to the project folder in your terminal  
type conda create -n cookieenv python=3.12  
type conda active cookieenv  
type pip install -r requirements.txt  
type python3 main.py  
In your browser, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/
